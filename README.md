# EntryXit 🚀  
**AI-Powered People Counting System**  

EntryXit is an advanced real-time people counting system that leverages **computer vision** and **deep learning** to track individuals entering and exiting a designated area.  

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Real-time Detection** – Identifies and tracks people using AI models  
✅ **Entry & Exit Tracking** – Automatically counts people entering/exiting  
✅ **Live Video Processing** – Works with webcam or CCTV feeds  
✅ **Customizable Zones** – Define entry/exit points dynamically  
✅ **Data Logging** – Store and analyze movement data  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – Computer vision processing  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling and manipulation  
- **YOLO / MobileNet / TensorFlow** – Deep learning models for object detection  

---

## 🎯 How It Works  
1️⃣ Captures a real-time video feed from a **webcam** or **CCTV**  
2️⃣ Uses **deep learning models** to detect people  
3️⃣ Defines **entry and exit zones** within the frame  
4️⃣ Tracks movement and updates the **counter dynamically**  
5️⃣ Stores data for **analytics and future enhancements**
